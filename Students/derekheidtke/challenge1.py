"""
Describe what happens to the figure as you vary ParameterP from zero to one.

	- As ParameterP increases, the figure shifts more and more to the right.
	i.e., The height of the bars represent how likely it is to have X number
	of successful (coin-flip results in a ONE) flips out of eight. So, as
	the probability of flipping a ONE increases, it is more likely that all
	of the coin flips result in ONE.


What is the most likely outcome for ParameterP = 0.7 and NumberFlips = 8?

	- The experimenter is most likely to see 6 ONEs out of the eight biased
	coin-flips, with a probability of approximately 30%.
